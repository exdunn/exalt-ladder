# EXALT LADDER
Web application for viewing ladders in Path of Exile.

Created as a framework for more features

Currently includes rank, character name, class, online status, dead status

Filter by class, character/account name, and league

Click on the character name to access their profile page on the official Path of Exile Website.

I created this application as a useful framework for requesting and processing information from the PoE API and plan to incorporate more functionality in the future.
